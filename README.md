# LargeFormatCharSheet5e

This project's goal is to create a more easy to read character sheet, but it will be spread out across more pages (paper is cheap tho).

First page is for general combat and stats, the attack column is large to accomodate casters.

Second page is for skills- The 5 blocks at the top are for things like Ki, Channel Divinity, etc. The 3 columns are for skills and feats to be filled out at player's discretion- this may get edited as this can be a pretty populated section. It is generic for now.
